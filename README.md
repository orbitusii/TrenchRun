### Twin-Stick Roguelike Shooter in a 3D Format

Welcome to the TrenchRun repo! I uh... don't have much to put in this readme just yet.
This is just a hobby project for me to explore and develop a game that isn't just another flight sim.
There might be some flight sim-like quirks, but the ultimate premise is NOT a flight sim. It's a twin-stick shooter.

## Fun Features
**NOTE:** not all features are implemented. This is just a list of things I want to have working.
- [x] 3D environment and movement (5DOF - XYZ, Pitch, Yaw)
- [ ] Quirky and fun enemy behavior
- [ ] Puzzles that test your skill and problem solving
- [ ] Roguelike, with randomized level layouts
- [ ] Abilities and weapons that make gameplay more interesting and dynamic, with an element of luck!
- [ ] **Big Bullet Hell's boss fights**
